# simple-chess-engine
simple and modifiable chess engine and gui for game analysis 

CURRENTLY THE ENGINE OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR USE.

This engine is meant to be a simple and comprehensible chess engine. The idea is that by reading the source code of the engine (and maybe by contributing to it) you can understand how moves of the evaluated game or position get their value.
